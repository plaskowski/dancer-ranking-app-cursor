# Comparison: Cursor Background Agents vs GitHub Copilot Coding Agent vs Claude Code

## Overview

This comparison covers three different types of AI coding tools:

1. **Cursor Background Agents** - Autonomous, asynchronous agents working in cloud environments
2. **GitHub Copilot Coding Agent** - Autonomous, asynchronous agents working via GitHub Actions  
3. **Claude Code** - Interactive, synchronous CLI tool working locally with API calls

**Important Note**: Claude Code is fundamentally different from the other two - it's not an autonomous background agent, but rather an interactive terminal-based coding assistant that works with you in real-time.

## 1. **Execution Model & Workflow**

### Cursor Background Agents
- **Autonomous operation**: Works independently in cloud environments, returns with completed tasks
- **Asynchronous execution**: Fire-and-forget workflow where you assign tasks and review results later
- **Visual task assignment**: Use screenshots and natural language prompts to assign work
- **Background processing**: Continue other work while agents handle assigned tasks

### GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
- **Autonomous operation**: Works independently via GitHub Actions infrastructure  
- **Asynchronous execution**: Assign via GitHub issues, agent works and creates pull requests
- **Issue-driven workflow**: Traditional GitHub issue assignment with `assignee: Copilot`
- **Background processing**: Runs in cloud while you work on other things

### Claude Code
- **Interactive operation**: Real-time conversation-based workflow in your terminal
- **Synchronous execution**: Work together step-by-step, observing each action
- **Direct CLI interaction**: Natural language commands in terminal environment
- **Immediate feedback**: See and approve each action as it happens

**Key Impact**: Cursor and Copilot are "delegate and review later" tools, while Claude Code is a "pair programming in terminal" tool.

## 2. **Technical Architecture & Environment**

### Cursor Background Agents
- **Cloud-first architecture**: Runs in isolated cloud environments with full compute resources
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on different tasks
- **Environment mirroring**: Snapshots your local environment to replicate it in the cloud
- **Resource scaling**: Can handle compute-intensive tasks without local machine limitations

### GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
- **GitHub Actions integration**: Executes within GitHub's secure cloud infrastructure
- **Repo cloning workflow**: Automatically clones repositories and sets up development environment  
- **Single-task focus**: Designed to work on one issue at a time per repository
- **Standardized environment**: Uses GitHub's consistent, reproducible build environments

### Claude Code
- **Local execution**: Runs as CLI on your machine, calls Claude API for AI capabilities
- **Tool-based architecture**: Has access to bash, file editing, git, and other local tools
- **Session-based**: Maintains conversation context within terminal sessions
- **Environment access**: Full access to your local development environment and tools

**Key Impact**: Cursor and Copilot provide isolated cloud environments, while Claude Code works directly in your local development setup.

## 3. **Autonomy Level & Decision Making**

### Cursor Background Agents
- **Full autonomous operation**: Works independently from task assignment to PR creation
- **Multi-step reasoning**: Can break down complex UI/UX tasks into implementation steps
- **Visual understanding**: Analyzes screenshots and mockups to understand requirements
- **Cross-file coordination**: Handles changes across multiple files and components simultaneously

### GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
- **Issue-scoped autonomy**: Works independently within the scope of assigned GitHub issues
- **Test-driven validation**: Automatically runs tests and linters to validate changes
- **Iterative improvement**: Can respond to PR feedback and refine solutions
- **Code quality focus**: Emphasizes writing tests and following coding best practices

### Claude Code
- **Guided autonomy**: Works autonomously within each conversation turn, but with human oversight
- **Tool orchestration**: Intelligently combines bash, file editing, and other tools to complete tasks
- **Interactive planning**: Creates and updates task lists, but you can intervene at any step
- **Transparent reasoning**: Shows its thinking process and asks for approval on potentially risky actions

**Key Impact**: Cursor and Copilot work fully autonomously, while Claude Code provides controllable autonomy with human oversight at every step.

## 4. **Integration & Ecosystem**

### Cursor Background Agents
- **IDE-agnostic**: Works independently of your local development environment
- **Direct branching**: Can automatically create and switch to feature branches
- **Status tracking**: Provides real-time progress updates and task monitoring
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Same experience regardless of your local setup

### GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
- **GitHub-native**: Deeply integrated with GitHub's project management and workflow tools
- **Enterprise ready**: Built with enterprise security, compliance, and governance in mind
- **Team collaboration**: Natural integration with code reviews, discussions, and team workflows
- **Established ecosystem**: Leverages GitHub's mature CI/CD and DevOps infrastructure

### Claude Code
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with any Git repository and development stack
- **MCP integration**: Supports Model Context Protocol for extending capabilities
- **Terminal-native**: Integrates seamlessly with existing terminal and shell workflows
- **Tool composability**: Works alongside existing development tools (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)

**Key Impact**: Cursor offers cloud flexibility, GitHub Copilot provides enterprise integration, while Claude Code offers universal compatibility with any development setup.

## 5. **Availability & Cost Model**

### Cursor Background Agents
- **Early access**: Currently in preview with limited availability
- **Premium pricing**: Uses expensive Max Mode for cloud execution (hundreds of dollars/month)
- **Pay-per-use**: Costs scale with agent usage and compute time
- **Flexible compute**: Can allocate more resources for complex tasks

### GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
- **Enterprise requirement**: Requires Copilot Pro+ ($39/month) or Enterprise subscription
- **Public preview**: Currently in preview with GitHub Actions integration
- **Predictable costs**: Fixed monthly pricing with included Actions minutes
- **Established platform**: Built on GitHub's proven infrastructure with enterprise SLAs

### Claude Code
- **Immediately available**: Public release, no waitlist or special access required
- **Transparent pricing**: Direct API costs (~$6/day average usage = ~$120-180/month)
- **Pay-per-token**: No subscription required, pure usage-based billing
- **Model flexibility**: Can choose between Sonnet 4 ($3/$15 per million tokens) or Opus 4 ($15/$75)

**Key Impact**: GitHub Copilot offers the most predictable costs, Claude Code provides transparent mid-range pricing, while Cursor is the most expensive but most capable option.
