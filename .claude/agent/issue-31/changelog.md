# Changelog: Issue #31 - Add Scroll-to-Bottom Feature for Dancer List

## Overview
Added a scroll-to-bottom floating action button (FAB) to the dancer list screen to help users quickly navigate to the bottom of long dancer lists, particularly after event imports.

## Changes Made

### üÜï New Features
- **MultiFABLayout Widget**: Created reusable widget for managing multiple floating action buttons with smooth animations
- **Scroll-to-Bottom FAB**: Added secondary FAB that appears when scrolling up from the bottom of the dancer list
- **Smooth Scroll Animation**: Implemented 500ms animated scroll to bottom with easing curve
- **Automatic FAB Management**: FAB automatically shows/hides based on scroll position with 100px threshold

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation
- **ScrollController Integration**: Added scroll position tracking to `_DancerListFilterWidget`
- **State Management**: Implemented callback system for scroll state changes between widgets
- **Animation System**: Used `AnimatedScale` for smooth FAB appearance/disappearance
- **Material Design Compliance**: Followed Material 3 design patterns for FAB positioning and behavior

### üìÅ Files Modified
- **`lib/widgets/multi_fab_layout.dart`** (New) - Multi-FAB layout widget with animation
- **`lib/screens/event/dialogs/base_dancer_selection_screen.dart`** (Modified) - Added scroll controller and FAB management
- **`test/widgets/multi_fab_layout_test.dart`** (New) - Comprehensive widget tests for MultiFABLayout

### üß™ Testing
- **Widget Tests**: Added 6 comprehensive tests for MultiFABLayout widget covering:
  - FAB visibility states
  - Animation behavior
  - Layout structure
  - Null handling
  - Animation duration and curves

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users had to manually scroll through potentially hundreds of dancers
- Especially problematic after event imports with many new dancers
- No quick navigation options for long lists

### After
- **Quick Navigation**: Scroll-to-bottom FAB appears when scrolling up from bottom
- **Smooth Animation**: Tapping FAB smoothly scrolls to bottom in 500ms
- **Smart Hiding**: FAB automatically hides when near bottom (100px threshold)
- **Non-intrusive**: FAB positioned above existing Add Dancer FAB without interference

## Technical Details

### Scroll Behavior
- **Trigger**: FAB appears when user scrolls up more than 100px from bottom
- **Animation**: Uses `Curves.easeInOut` for smooth scrolling experience
- **Performance**: Optimized with proper disposal of scroll controllers

### FAB Layout
- **Primary FAB**: Existing Add Dancer button (bottom position)
- **Secondary FAB**: Scroll-to-bottom button (appears above primary)
- **Spacing**: 16px vertical spacing between FABs
- **Animation**: 200ms scale animation for secondary FAB appearance

### Integration
- **Automatic Inheritance**: `DancersScreen` automatically inherits functionality through `BaseDancerListScreen`
- **Reusable Architecture**: `MultiFABLayout` widget can be reused across the app
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Performance Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of ScrollController and listeners
- **State Optimization**: Efficient state updates with threshold-based FAB visibility
- **Animation Performance**: Lightweight scale animations for smooth UX

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Scroll-to-top functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- Custom scroll speeds
- Jump to specific alphabet sections

## Breaking Changes
None - this is a purely additive feature with no breaking changes to existing functionality.

## Dependencies
- Uses existing Flutter/Material 3 components
- No additional external dependencies required
- Follows project's existing architecture patterns
