Next:
- try out Android app!

Nice to have:
- import ranking from another event
- mark a present dancer as missed if they left before I managed to ask them for a dance
- dancers avatars?

Working with cursor:
- update the rule
  - commit the impl update and next steps update in the commit
- ability to run user stories to check for regression testing
