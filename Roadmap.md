# Dancer Ranking App - Roadmap

## Plans
- first milestone (see Roadmap_milestone1.md)
- further plans (see section below)

## Further plans
- dancers pool category - see feature_DancersPoolCategory.md
- export the party summary to the Diary
- Statistical insights and trends
- Use emojis in Rank names
- Filter people by tags. Eg. tag about where I know them from in case I don't know or remember the name or #longTimeNoSee or #comesRarely
- in mass add in planning tab and add existing dancer dialog somehow filter out the dancers that come very rare or have not yet come for a long time
  - I won't backfill whole dancing history so I may need to set some info on the person
- People archival
  - they should stay in the past events but don't suggest them to be added
- Switch for filtering off dancers that 'left' in Present Tab
- rank emoji (so to present it alinged to right)
- Smart suggestions based on dancing history

### Rejected ideas
- Event templates for recurring event types
  - I can just have an event with future date that serves as a template
- Dancers avatars/photos
- Internationalization support
