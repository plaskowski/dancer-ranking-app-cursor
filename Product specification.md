# Problem statement
I am a social dancer. I attend many social dancing parties where I can with a lot of partners.
I know most of them, some I meet there the first time.
My problem is the overwhelming decision making who should I ask for a dance.
This should be decided based on my overall attitude toward given person but can be influenced by current situation,
e.g. I may have not seen given person for a long time or they are looking really good that day.
The other problem is that there are so many people at the party that I quickly forget who is there 
and that I wanted to ask that person for a dance later that day.

# Proposed solution
A mobile app called "dancer ranking" that lets me plan an upcoming dance event, 
by listing people I expect might attend the event and state how eager I am to dance with them.
Then, during the party it lets me quickly note down who is present and see what is my planned attitute towards them.
There can be multiple reasons why I either want or don't want to dance with them.
Then, after the dance I want to mark that I have danced with them.
Sometimes I meet new people, so I want to add a new person.
I may want to add a comment why I am eager to dance with given person.
Later I may want to add a comment on my impression on given person that night.
