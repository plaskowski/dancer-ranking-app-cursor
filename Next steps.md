# Next Steps

## Immediate Priorities (take one at a time)
- **Data Export**: Add ability to export event data and dancer rankings so I can import it on different platform

## Later
- **Test Event Import UI**: Manually test the full-screen Event Import UI and verify the "new dancer" count is accurate.
- tap tag pill to filter the list by that tag
- **Backup/Restore**: Implement data backup and restore functionality

See `Roadmap.md` for comprehensive future plans and feature roadmap.
