# tweak wireframes
- create event screen
  - I want only date
- Event screen
  - remove Dancers button from the app bar
  - don't use stars for ranks, ranks are not easily comparable (despite global order)
  - the buttons in the row make too much clutter, let's use a pattern "tap to show row actions dialog" instead
- Planning tab
  - group the dancers by rank similar to Present tab
  - indicate that given person was already marked as present
