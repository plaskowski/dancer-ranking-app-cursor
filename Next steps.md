# Next Steps

## Immediate Priorities (take one at a time)
- fill the spec with additional things
- rename export to backup to file, add an action to restore from file

## Later
- **Test Event Import UI**: Manually test the full-screen Event Import UI and verify the "new dancer" count is accurate.
- tap tag pill to filter the list by that tag
- **Event Diary Parser**: Parse events from the diary, deciding where to put the overall impression (e.g., "Bardzo udane").
  - Provide agent with an example to understand the structure.
- merge person duplicates (e.g. I learned the name after few parties)
- merge score duplicates

See `Roadmap.md` for comprehensive future plans and feature roadmap.
