## Status
The app has all I need to start using it. :celebrate:

## RTB work
Next:
- check file sizes and suggest classes to be extracted to reduce big files
- settings screen
  - remove tag icon from tag screen rows
  - migrate tags screen

Nice to haves:
- move all main screen actions (except Dancers) under the three dots, Import events should be the last
- mark current events dates green (with the same logic as for showing tabs in event screen, have the logic reused)
- enter in edit name dialog should confirm it

Bugs:
- when I edit impression the text field should contain current impression text

How to - VS Code:
- always open Markdown files in preview
  - add vscode.markdown.preview.editor in "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)" > "editor assoc"
