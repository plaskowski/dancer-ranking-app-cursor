## Status
The app has all I need to start using it. 

## Optional improvements
- scrolling grouping header in summary tab
- ...

## RTB work
Nice to haves:
- settings screen
- move all main screen actions (except Dancers) under the three dots, Import events should be the last
- reorganize code into sub-dirs per screen (plus common for shared things)
- mark current events dates green (with the same logic as for showing tabs in event screen, have the logic reused)

Bugs:
- when I edit impression the text field should contain current impression text
