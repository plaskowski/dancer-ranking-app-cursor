## Status
The app has all I need to start using it. :celebrate:

## RTB work
Next:
- increase the 25 tool calls limit
- allow it to delete .dart and .md files
- check file sizes and suggest classes to be extracted to reduce big files
- settings screen

Nice to haves:
- move all main screen actions (except Dancers) under the three dots, Import events should be the last
- mark current events dates green (with the same logic as for showing tabs in event screen, have the logic reused)
- enter in edit name dialog should confirm it

Bugs:
- when I edit impression the text field should contain current impression text
