// This file is used by the human to track things that come up to their mind during working with Cursor Agent.
// Agent should never modify this file so not to overwrite the human entered content.

## Status
The app has all I need to start using it. :celebrate:

## Tasks list (take one at a time)
Next:
- [X] settings screen
- [X] how to run second cursor agent on separate branch of the same repo

Nice to haves:
- move all main screen actions (except Dancers) under the three dots, Import events should be the last
- mark current events dates green (with the same logic as for showing tabs in event screen, have the logic reused)
- enter in edit name dialog should confirm it
- (bug) when I edit impression the text field should contain current impression text

## Cursor Cheatsheet
- always open Markdown files in preview
  - add vscode.markdown.preview.editor in "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)" > "editor assoc"
