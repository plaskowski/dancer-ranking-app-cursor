Nice to haves:
- move all main screen actions (except Dancers) under the three dots, Import events should be the last
- mark current events dates green (with the same logic as for showing tabs in event screen, have the logic reused)
- enter in edit name dialog should confirm it
- (bug) when I edit impression the text field should contain current impression text
