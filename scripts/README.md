# Event Import Scripts

## validate_imports.sh

This script validates all JSON files in a directory to ensure they can be imported into the app.

### Usage

```bash
# Validate files in the default test_import_files directory
./scripts/validate_imports.sh

# Validate files in a specific directory
./scripts/validate_imports.sh my_json_files
```

### What it does

The script will:
1. Scan the specified directory for JSON files
2. Validate each file's structure and content
3. Check for common issues like missing names, invalid statuses, etc.
4. Provide a detailed summary of validation results
5. Show specific error messages for any problems found

### Example Output

## fix_event_names.py

This script automatically fixes JSON event files by adding default names to events that are missing them. This allows importing historical event data even when event names are missing.

### Usage

```bash
# Fix a file and create a new output file
python3 scripts/fix_event_names.py input_file.json output_file.json

# Fix a file in place (overwrites the original)
python3 scripts/fix_event_names.py input_file.json
```

### What it does

The script will:
1. Read your JSON event file
2. Check each event for missing, null, or empty `name` fields
3. Generate default names like "Event on January 15, 2024" based on the event date
4. Save the fixed file

### Example

**Before:**
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "name": null,
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "attendances": [...]
    },
    {
      "date": "2024-01-20",
      "attendances": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "Event on January 15, 2024",
      "date": "2024-01-15",
      "attendances": [...]
    },
    {
      "name": "Event on January 20, 2024",
      "date": "2024-01-20",
      "attendances": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional dependencies required

### Notes

- The script preserves all other data in your JSON files
- Events that already have valid names are left unchanged
- Default names are generated in a readable format (e.g., "Event on January 15, 2024")
- The script handles various date formats automatically

# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for the Dancer Ranking App.

## Release Script

The `release.sh` script automates the release process by:
1. Bumping the version number
2. Building the APK
3. Creating a GitHub release with the APK
4. Committing and pushing changes

### Prerequisites

1. **Flutter**: Must be installed and in PATH
2. **GitHub CLI**: Must be installed and authenticated
   ```bash
   # Install GitHub CLI
   # macOS
   brew install gh
   
   # Linux
   sudo apt install gh
   
   # Windows
   winget install GitHub.cli
   
   # Authenticate
   gh auth login
   ```

### Usage

```bash
# Bump patch version (default)
./scripts/release.sh

# Bump minor version
./scripts/release.sh minor

# Bump major version
./scripts/release.sh major
```

### What it does

1. **Version Bumping**: Reads current version from `Changelog.md` and increments it
2. **Changelog Update**: Adds a new version section to the changelog
3. **APK Build**: Cleans, gets dependencies, and builds release APK
4. **GitHub Release**: Creates a release with the APK and release notes
5. **Git Operations**: Commits changes and pushes to main branch

### Output

- APK file uploaded to GitHub releases
- Version bumped in changelog
- Changes committed and pushed to repository
- Release URL provided in output

### Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error checking:
- Prerequisites validation
- Build failure detection
- GitHub CLI authentication check
- File existence verification

### Configuration
