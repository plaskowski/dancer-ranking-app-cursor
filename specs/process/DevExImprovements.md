## Cursor based development improvements
- Ability to run user stories for regression testing
- Automated testing before marking tasks as done
- User acceptance testing protocols
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Add a rule for the workflow to write down the mistakes that were made by cursor and add a cursor rule that will prevent it in the future
- rule to always pick up only one task
- how to keep the UX patterns consistent
- if I can make it use automated user stories validation it could run on its own for long time
  - it would be great to make it record the screens (as screenshots or video) when running these tests so I can review them
  - they also will be useful for project documentation
- increase the 25 tool calls limit
- rule to refactor code to new files
- rule to add actions tracking to new code
- a way to run flutter run so that it closes the terminal tab when it ends
- after coming up with the design ask it to validate it against existing UX patterns in the app
- keep a separte human-only todolist file to not lost your toughts chain
- close all editor windows after commit
