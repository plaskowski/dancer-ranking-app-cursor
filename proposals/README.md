## Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Create**: Add new proposal with `ðŸŸ¡ PROPOSAL` status
2. **Review**: Change status to `ðŸŸ  UNDER_REVIEW` 
3. **Decision**: 
   - Approve: `ðŸŸ¢ APPROVED` â†’ plan implementation
   - Reject: `ðŸ”´ REJECTED` â†’ move to `archive/rejected/`
4. **Implement**: When implementation begins, move to appropriate system docs
5. **Complete**: Remove from proposals, ensure it's in main documentation

```markdown
# Proposal: [Title]

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive, kebab-case names
- Include the type in the path (not filename)
- Example: `features/dancer-activity-tracking.md`

## Moving from Proposals to Implementation

When a proposal is approved and implemented:

1. **Update main documentation** (specs/, docs/, etc.)
2. **Update proposal status** to âœ… IMPLEMENTED
3. **Add link to implementation** in proposal
4. **Remove proposal file** after 1-2 weeks (keep in git history)

## Integration with Existing System

- **Proposals**: Stay in `proposals/` directory
- **Specifications**: Move to `specs/` when approved but not implemented  
- **Documentation**: Move to `docs/` when implemented
- **Implementation**: Track in main codebase and `Implementation specification.md`
