# Documentation Proposals

This directory contains proposals related to improving the documentation system.

## Active Proposals

### ðŸŸ¡ Multi-Agent Documentation Structure
- **File**: [multi-agent-docs-structure.md](multi-agent-docs-structure.md)
- **Supporting Document**: [implementation-guide.md](implementation-guide.md)
- **Status**: PROPOSAL
- **Summary**: Restructure documentation from large monolithic files into a modular, multi-agent friendly system

**Problem**: Current documentation has large files (57KB Changelog, 42KB Product spec) that cause merge conflicts when multiple agents update simultaneously.

**Solution**: Split into smaller, atomic files with clear ownership boundaries and coordination metadata.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Review and approve the proposal
2. Decide on implementation timeline
3. Begin Phase 1 migration if approved

## Directory Purpose

This directory demonstrates the proposed structure for organizing proposals vs. implemented documentation:

- **Proposals** (ðŸŸ¡): Stay here until approved/rejected
- **Approved** (ðŸŸ¢): Move to specs/ when approved but not implemented
- **Implemented** (âœ…): Move to docs/ when implemented and remove from proposals

## Template

For new documentation proposals, use the template from [../README.md](../README.md).
