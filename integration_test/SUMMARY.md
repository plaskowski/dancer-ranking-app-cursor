- Test runner script for easy execution
- Device detection
- Error handling

#### `README.md`
- Comprehensive documentation
- Running instructions
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- Integration test framework setup
- Simple UI tests (`simple_ui_test.dart`)
- Test runner script
- Documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues
- Database-dependent tests fail on Linux due to SQLite library issues
- Some existing unit tests have SQLite dependency problems

### üîß Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Run `simple_ui_test.dart` to verify basic functionality
2. **Short-term**: Fix SQLite library issues for Linux environment
3. **Medium-term**: Expand integration tests to cover more user workflows
4. **Long-term**: Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Running Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the simple UI tests (recommended for now)
flutter test integration_test/simple_ui_test.dart

# Run all integration tests (may fail due to SQLite issues)
flutter test integration_test/

# Use the test runner script
./integration_test/run_integration_tests.sh
```

### Platform-Specific
```bash
# Android
flutter test integration_test/simple_ui_test.dart -d android

# macOS
flutter test integration_test/simple_ui_test.dart -d macos
```

## Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ Covered
- App launch and basic UI
- Navigation between main tabs
- Settings screen structure
- Floating action button presence

### üìã Planned
- Event creation workflow
- Dancer management workflow
- Import functionality
- Ranking system
- Database operations (once SQLite issues resolved)

## Benefits

1. **End-to-End Testing**: Tests complete user workflows
2. **UI Verification**: Ensures UI elements are present and accessible
3. **Navigation Testing**: Verifies app navigation works correctly
4. **Regression Prevention**: Catches breaking changes in user flows
5. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of app behavior

## Integration with Development Workflow

- Tests can be run before commits to ensure no regressions
- CI/CD pipeline can run integration tests automatically
- Tests provide confidence when refactoring UI components
- Integration tests complement existing unit tests
