# Dancer Ranking App - Cursor Rules

## Documentation Sync Rule
**CRITICAL**: Whenever you make changes to the implementation (code, UI, functionality, data models), you MUST also update the corresponding sections in the Implementation specification.md file.

### Always Update Specification For:
- **New features or functionality**: Add to relevant screen descriptions, navigation flow, key features
- **UI/UX changes**: Update screen descriptions, actions, navigation patterns
- **Data model changes**: Update database schema, relationships, workflow descriptions
- **Dialog/modal changes**: Update navigation flow and screen actions
- **Service method changes**: Update workflow descriptions and feature explanations
- **Tab behavior changes**: Update tab-specific actions and navigation flow
- **Context action additions**: Update actions lists and workflow steps

### Specification Sections to Consider:
- **Screens section**: Update affected screen descriptions and actions
- **Navigation Flow**: Update flowchart when navigation changes
- **Event Workflow**: Update workflow steps when user experience changes
- **Key Features**: Add new features or update existing feature descriptions
- **Database Schema**: Update when data models change

### Process:
1. Make implementation changes
2. Identify which specification sections are affected
3. Update the specification to match the new implementation
4. Ensure examples and workflow descriptions are accurate
5. Update navigation flow diagrams if needed

### Example Triggers:
- Adding new buttons or actions → Update screen actions
- Changing dialog content → Update navigation flow
- Adding new screens → Update navigation flow and screens section
- Modifying user workflow → Update event workflow section
- Adding database fields → Update schema section

## Code Quality Rules
- Use descriptive variable and method names
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Follow Flutter/Dart conventions
- Use proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Implement loading states for async operations

## UI/UX Consistency
- Use consistent color schemes (blue for primary actions, green for success, red for errors)
- Provide visual feedback for user actions (snackbars, loading indicators)
- Follow Material Design principles
- Ensure accessibility with proper semantic labels
